avr-amiga-controller
--------------------

This software will allow you to control an Amiga using your
PC keyboard and mouse - without unplugging them from your
PC.

It works as follows:

 - You run a synergy server on your PC (http://synergy-foss.org)
 - You configure a hotkey to switch to screen "amiga".
 - The input from PC is redirected to the synergy-hw client
      (Find this in the hostapp directory.)
 - The firmware is flashed to an Atmega32U2 board 
      (such as minimus 32 AVR)
 - synergy-hw streams input to the AVR.
 - The AVR emulates bus mouse and amiga keyboard signals 
       (at hardware level)

Of course, you also need to build correct cabling to connect the AVR
to the Amiga keyboard and mouse ports. The mapping is like this

AVR           Amiga (Bus Mouse) Mouse port
PB4           XA
PB5           XB
PB6           YA 
PB7           YB
PC4           LEFT MOUSE BUTTON
PC5           RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON
PC6           MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON
GND           GND

AVR           Amiga Keyboard Port
PD0           CLOCK
PD1           DATA
GND           GND

To compile it, you need to get LUFA library and put the path in
the firmware/Makefile. Then run make from top level to build both
parts of the software.

To flash the firmware to your board and to run synergy-hw you need 
to give your user permission on the AVR usb device. Put this in
/etc/udev/rules.d/minimus.rules:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTR{idProduct}=="*", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ATTR{idVendor}=="f055", ATTR{idProduct}=="*", GROUP="plugdev"

(First line is for the bootloader, for flashing. Second line is the 
device when running this firmware. Your user needs to be in group 
plugdev.)

Make a synergy.conf like this:

section: screens
  linux:
  amiga:
end

section: options
  keystroke(super+a) = lockCursorToScreen(on), switchToScreen(amiga)
  keystroke(super+z) = switchToScreen(linux), lockCursorToScreen(off)
  relativeMouseMoves = true
end

Launch synergys using this config:

synergys -f -c synergy.conf -n linux

Launch synergy-hw (no argument necessary, screen name and server 
                   address are hardcoded)

Press windows-a to flip to Amiga
Press windows-z to return to PC.

While controlling Amiga, pressing End will reboot the Amiga.
